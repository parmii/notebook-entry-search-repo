# Documentation for Notebook Entry Search Project
Notebook Entry Search Service is used to search frequency of word and similar words against given words

## Reference Documentation

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org)

## Approach
- Created one microservice notebookentry-search-service
- Since we are keeping the data in memory, both the APIs should be up for proper function
- Embedded H2 database has been used to store notebooks and its entries
- schema.sql and data.sql are loaded while application intialization and dummy notebooks with notebook entries are created
- For entries such as very big files, different APIs have been exposed, which are /file/frequency and /file/similarwords

## Assumptions
- Notebooks and notebook entries already exist in the system
- Levenshtein Distance is case-sensitive. For eg. Word and WORD are not similar words

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. 
One way is to execute the `main` method 

execute the `main` method of `com.labforward.notebook.NotebookEntrySearchServiceApp` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use
the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html)
like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```

#### Testing
- This application has been tested against 1GB file. It takes approximately 40 seconds to 50 seconds to get the data
- 'labforward_notebook_entry.txt' is the file for testing, test it by adding more content to it
- Unit test cases have been added for all the classes

#### Scope of improvements
